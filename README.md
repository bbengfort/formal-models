# Formal Models 

**Formal models specified iwth TLA+ and PlusCal** 

Ensure that the `modules` directory is added to the libraries path of your TLA+ Toolbox! 

Note that the original Raft specification can be found here: [github.com/ongardie/raft.tla](https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla). The version here is modified with the model invariants as specified by [@jinlmsft](https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla/pull/4/) and to include details for hierarchical consensus.
